Hello, 


|||||||||| ALL FILES INSIDE "Project 2\Project 4\src" |||||||||||||||
|||||||||| There is a second compressed verion included in the file |||||||||||

To run the program:
You will be asked to enter a number 1 OR 2 for either BST or AVL. Both of them will test the tree by inserting a random value that are generated insistently, height 3, 4, and 5 would be tested for each case. 

Everything is clear when you run the code.

thanks for reading me ^_^ . And I hope you a nice day!
